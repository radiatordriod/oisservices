            <p class="para-section">
              There are six alternative ways in which the lawfulness of a specific case of processing of personal data may be established under the GDPR. It is OIS policy to identify the appropriate basis for processing and to document it, in accordance with the Regulation. The options are described in brief in the following sections.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 Consent</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the GDPR, OIS will always obtain explicit consent from a data subject to collect and process their data. In case of children below the age of 16 (a lower age may be allowable in specific EU member states) parental consent will be obtained. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data will be provided to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained and their rights with regard to their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent. This information will be provided in an accessible form, written in clear language and free of charge. If the personal data are not obtained directly from the data subject then this information will be provided to the data subject within a reasonable period after the data are obtained and definitely within one month.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 Performance of a Contract</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Where the personal data collected and processed are required to fulfil a contract with the data subject, explicit consent is not required. This will often be the case where the contract cannot be completed without the personal data in question e.g. a delivery cannot be made without an address to deliver to.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 Legal Obligation</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              If the personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit consent is not required. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for example, and for many areas addressed by the public sector.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 Vital Interests of the Data Subject</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              In a case where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing. OIS will retain reasonable, documented evidence that this is the case, whenever this reason is used as the lawful basis of the processing of personal data. As an example, this may be used in aspects of social care, particularly in the public sector.

              Transfers of personal data outside the European Union will be carefully reviewed prior to the transfer taking place to ensure that they fall within the limits imposed by the GDPR. This depends partly on the European Commission\'s judgement as to the adequacy of the safeguards for personal data applicable in the receiving country and this may change over time.<br>Intra-group international data transfers will be subject to legally binding agreements referred to as Binding Corporate Rules (BCR) which provide enforceable rights for data subjects.

In line with the GDPR, where a breach is known to have occurred which is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the relevant supervisory authority will be informed within 72 hours. This will be managed in accordance with our Information Security Incident Response Procedure which sets out the overall process of handling information security incidents.

            <p class="para-section">
              There are 8 data protection principles which ensure that organisations collect, store and process personal data in a way that protects the confidentiality of customers. These principles are set out in schedule 1 of the Act and are as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              i. Data must be handled fairly and lawfully<br>We have legitimate grounds to obtain, store and process customers\' data, namely, to assist you obtain a passport, visa and for other purposes authorised by the law and contracts between us and our customers. We ensure that your data will not be used for anything unlawful.
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              ii. Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.<br>Due to the nature of our job, the purpose for which you are giving us your personal data is obvious to you and us. We will not use your data for any other purpose incompatible with the original purpose unless you first give us your consent or we are compelled by law to do so.
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              iii. Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.<br>We will only take information we consider relevant and sufficient to deliver our contract with you.
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              iv. Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.<br>We ensure that the personal data you give us is correct and not misleading. We achieve this by giving you the opportunity to confirm the information you give us and also by requesting documentary proof when necessary. If there are relevant changes in your personal data, eg, change of name or nationality, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can update your record.
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              v. Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.<br>We will, from time to time, review our data base to see if some personal data are still needed to be stored by us. If the purpose for which they were stored has been achieved and we consider that it is no longer necessary to continue storing them, we will securely delete them.
            </p>
            <p class="para-section">
              vi. Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.<br>We will process your personal data in such a way that it will enable you to do any of the following:

            <ul class="para-list-digit">

The current fee for that is £10 per standard request and we aim to provide this within 14 days. Subject Access Request should be made to info@oisservices.com by email or by post The Head of Centre, OIS Services, 56-57 Fleet street, EC4Y 1JU, London </li>
              <li>

              <li>
                a right to prevent processing your personal data in a way that is incompatible to the original purpose or purposes;

            </ul>
            <p class="para-section">
              vii. Personal data security<br>Your personal data are held in a very secure environment both physically and technically. The areas where personal data are kept are out of bounds for all non-authorised persons. Access to these parts of the premises can only be gained by electronic key issued only to authorised persons. Your personal data can only be accessed on the system by authorised persons. Only such authorised persons can alter, disclose or destroy your personal data. Further, such authorised persons can only carry out any of those functions in the course of their lawful duties. Therefore, the chances of your personal data being unlawfully processed or accidentally damaged, destroyed or lost are very minimal.
              Further, it is our policy to ensure that:
            </p>
            <ul class="para-list-digit">
              <li>
                each authorised employee who has access to personal data has his own password which is not shared with other persons,

              <li>
                printed personal data not in use are shredded,

              <li>
                we discourage personal data being stored on laptops and other mobile devices and media but if they do, should be locked securely and not taken out of the office.

            </ul>
            <p class="para-section">
              viii. Transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area<br>Your personal data will not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data. There are only few counties outside the EEA that have been accepted as having adequate levels of protection for the processing of persona data comparable to the EEA countries. When we are transferring personal data to the USA, we ensure that the recipient is a signatory to the US Department of Commerce Safe Harbour Scheme. This scheme is recognised by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for data subjects. In relation to other countries outside the EEA that have not been accepted as having equivalent security and safeguards in place for processing personal data, we either sign a separate contract, the terms of which are approved by the European Directives or ensure that there is a clause in the contract that protects the processing of personal data of all our clients.

            <p class="para-section">
              根据 GDPR，可以通过六种替代方式确定个人数据处理特定案例的合法性。 OIS 的政策是根据该法规确定适当的处理基础并将其记录下来。 以下各节简要描述了这些选项。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 同意</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              除非 GDPR 允许的原因有必要，否则 OIS 将始终获得数据主体的明确同意来收集和处理其数据。 如果儿童未满 16 岁（特定欧盟成员国可能允许更低的年龄），将获得父母的同意。 有关我们使用其个人数据的透明信息将在获得同意时提供给数据主体，并解释他们对其数据的权利，例如撤回同意的权利。 该信息将以易于理解的形式、以清晰的语言编写且免费提供。 如果个人数据不是直接从数据主体获得的，则该信息将在获得数据后的合理期限内（当然是一个月内）提供给数据主体。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 合同履行</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              如果收集和处理的个人数据是为了履行与数据主体之间的合同而需要的，则无需明确同意。 通常情况下，如果没有相关个人数据，合同就无法完成，例如： 如果没有交付地址，则无法进行交付。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 法律义务</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              如果为了遵守法律而需要收集和处理个人数据，则不需要明确同意。 例如，与就业和税收相关的一些数据以及公共部门处理的许多领域的数据可能就是这种情况。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 数据主体的切身利益</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              如果需要个人数据来保护数据主体或其他自然人的切身利益，则可以将其用作处理的合法依据。 每当该理由被用作个人数据处理的合法依据时，OIS 将保留证明这种情况的合理、书面证据。 例如，这可以用于社会护理方面，特别是在公共部门。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 为公共利益而执行的任务</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              如果 OIS 需要执行其认为符合公共利益或作为官方职责一部分的任务，则无需征求数据主体的同意。 对公共利益或官方职责的评估将被记录下来并在需要时作为证据提供。
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 合法权益</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              如果特定个人数据的处理符合 OIS 的合法利益，并且被判断不会对数据主体的权利和自由产生重大影响，则可以将其定义为处理的合法理由。 同样，该观点背后的推理将被记录下来。

                8 项数据保护原则可确保组织以保护客户机密的方式收集、存储和处理个人数据。 这些原则载于该法案附表 1，具体如下：
              </p>
              <p class="para-section">
                我。 数据必须公平合法地处理<br>我们有合法理由获取、存储和处理客户的数据，即协助您获得护照、签证以及用于法律和我们与客户之间的合同授权的其他目的 。 我们确保您的数据不会被用于任何非法行为。

                四. 个人数据应准确，并在必要时保持最新。<br>我们确保您向我们提供的个人数据是正确的且不具有误导性。 我们通过让您有机会确认您向我们提供的信息以及在必要时要求提供文件证明来实现这一目标。 如果您的个人资料发生相关变更，例如姓名或国籍变更，请尽快告知我们，以便我们更新您的记录。
              </p>
              <p class="para-section">

            <p class="para-section">
              هناك ست طرق بديلة يمكن من خلالها تحديد مشروعية حالة معينة لمعالجة البيانات الشخصية بموجب اللائحة العامة لحماية البيانات. تتمثل سياسة OIS في تحديد الأساس المناسب للمعالجة وتوثيقه، وفقًا للائحة. يتم وصف الخيارات باختصار في الأقسام التالية.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 الموافقة</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              ما لم يكن ذلك ضروريًا لسبب مسموح به في اللائحة العامة لحماية البيانات، ستحصل OIS دائمًا على موافقة صريحة من صاحب البيانات لجمع بياناته ومعالجتها. في حالة الأطفال الذين تقل أعمارهم عن 16 عامًا (قد يكون السن الأقل مسموحًا به في بعض الدول الأعضاء في الاتحاد الأوروبي) سيتم الحصول على موافقة الوالدين. سيتم توفير معلومات شفافة حول استخدامنا لبياناتهم الشخصية لأصحاب البيانات في وقت الحصول على الموافقة وشرح حقوقهم فيما يتعلق ببياناتهم، مثل الحق في سحب الموافقة. سيتم توفير هذه المعلومات في شكل يسهل الوصول إليه، ومكتوبة بلغة واضحة ومجانية. إذا لم يتم الحصول على البيانات الشخصية مباشرة من صاحب البيانات، فسيتم تقديم هذه المعلومات إلى صاحب البيانات خلال فترة معقولة بعد الحصول على البيانات وبالتأكيد خلال شهر واحد.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 أداء العقد</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              عندما تكون البيانات الشخصية التي تم جمعها ومعالجتها مطلوبة للوفاء بعقد مع صاحب البيانات، لا يلزم الحصول على موافقة صريحة. سيكون هذا هو الحال غالبًا عندما لا يمكن إكمال العقد بدون البيانات الشخصية المعنية، على سبيل المثال. لا يمكن أن يتم التسليم دون عنوان للتوصيل إليه.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 الالتزام القانوني</div>

              إذا كان من الضروري جمع البيانات الشخصية ومعالجتها من أجل الامتثال للقانون، فلن تكون هناك حاجة إلى موافقة صريحة. وقد يكون هذا هو الحال بالنسبة لبعض البيانات المتعلقة بالتوظيف والضرائب على سبيل المثال، وبالنسبة للعديد من المجالات التي يتناولها القطاع العام.

            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 الاهتمامات الحيوية لصاحب البيانات</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              في الحالة التي تكون فيها البيانات الشخصية مطلوبة لحماية المصالح الحيوية لصاحب البيانات أو لشخص طبيعي آخر، فيمكن استخدام ذلك كأساس قانوني للمعالجة. سوف تحتفظ OIS بأدلة معقولة وموثقة تثبت أن هذا هو الحال، عندما يتم استخدام هذا السبب كأساس قانوني لمعالجة البيانات الشخصية. على سبيل المثال، يمكن استخدام هذا في جوانب الرعاية الاجتماعية، وخاصة في القطاع العام.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 المهمة التي يتم تنفيذها للمصلحة العامة</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              عندما تحتاج OIS إلى أداء مهمة تعتقد أنها تصب في المصلحة العامة أو كجزء من واجب رسمي، فلن يتم طلب موافقة صاحب البيانات. سيتم توثيق تقييم المصلحة العامة أو الواجب الرسمي وإتاحته كدليل عند الاقتضاء.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 المصالح المشروعة</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              إذا كانت معالجة بيانات شخصية محددة في المصالح المشروعة لـ OIS ويُحكم أنها لا تؤثر على حقوق وحريات صاحب البيانات بطريقة كبيرة، فيمكن تعريف ذلك على أنه السبب القانوني للمعالجة. ومرة أخرى، سيتم توثيق الأسباب الكامنة وراء هذا الرأي.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.6 الخصوصية حسب التصميم</div>

            <p class="para-section">
              Il existe six manières alternatives d\'établir la licéité d\'un cas spécifique de traitement de données personnelles dans le cadre du RGPD. La politique de l\'OIS est d\'identifier la base appropriée du traitement et de la documenter, conformément au règlement. Les options sont décrites brièvement dans les sections suivantes.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 Consentement</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Sauf si cela est nécessaire pour une raison autorisée par le RGPD, OIS obtiendra toujours le consentement explicite d\'une personne concernée pour collecter et traiter ses données. Dans le cas d\'enfants de moins de 16 ans (un âge inférieur peut être autorisé dans certains États membres de l\'UE), le consentement parental sera obtenu. Des informations transparentes sur notre utilisation de leurs données personnelles seront fournies aux personnes concernées au moment où le consentement est obtenu et leurs droits concernant leurs données expliqués, comme le droit de retirer leur consentement. Ces informations seront fournies sous une forme accessible, rédigées dans un langage clair et gratuitement. Si les données personnelles ne sont pas obtenues directement auprès de la personne concernée, ces informations seront fournies à la personne concernée dans un délai raisonnable après l\'obtention des données et définitivement dans un délai d\'un mois.

            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 Exécution d\'un contrat</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Lorsque les données personnelles collectées et traitées sont nécessaires à l\'exécution d\'un contrat avec la personne concernée, le consentement explicite n\'est pas requis. Ce sera souvent le cas lorsque le contrat ne peut être exécuté sans les données personnelles en question, par ex. une livraison ne peut être effectuée sans adresse de livraison.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 Obligation légale</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Si la collecte et le traitement des données personnelles sont nécessaires pour respecter la loi, un consentement explicite n\'est pas requis. Cela peut être le cas pour certaines données liées à l\'emploi et à la fiscalité par exemple, ainsi que pour de nombreux domaines abordés par le secteur public.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 Intérêts vitaux de la personne concernée</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Dans le cas où les données personnelles sont nécessaires à la protection des intérêts vitaux de la personne concernée ou d\'une autre personne physique, elles peuvent alors être utilisées comme base licite du traitement. OIS conservera des preuves raisonnables et documentées attestant que tel est le cas, chaque fois que cette raison est utilisée comme base légale du traitement des données personnelles. À titre d\'exemple, cela peut être utilisé dans certains aspects de la protection sociale, en particulier dans le secteur public.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 Tâche réalisée dans l\'intérêt public</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Lorsque l\'OIS doit effectuer une tâche qu\'il estime être dans l\'intérêt public ou dans le cadre d\'une mission officielle, le consentement de la personne concernée ne sera pas demandé. L’évaluation de l’intérêt public ou de la fonction officielle sera documentée et mise à disposition comme preuve si nécessaire.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 Intérêts légitimes</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Si le traitement de données personnelles spécifiques est dans l\'intérêt légitime d\'OIS et est jugé ne pas affecter de manière significative les droits et libertés de la personne concernée, cela peut alors être défini comme la raison légitime du traitement. Encore une fois, le raisonnement derrière ce point de vue sera documenté.

            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5 Rechtmäßigkeit der Verarbeitung</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Es gibt sechs alternative Möglichkeiten, die Rechtmäßigkeit einer bestimmten Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten im Rahmen der DSGVO festzustellen. Es ist die Politik des OIS, die geeignete Grundlage für die Verarbeitung zu ermitteln und diese gemäß der Verordnung zu dokumentieren. Die Optionen werden in den folgenden Abschnitten kurz beschrieben.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 Einwilligung</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Sofern dies nicht aus einem in der DSGVO zulässigen Grund erforderlich ist, wird OIS stets die ausdrückliche Einwilligung einer betroffenen Person zur Erhebung und Verarbeitung ihrer Daten einholen. Bei Kindern unter 16 Jahren (in bestimmten EU-Mitgliedstaaten kann ein niedrigeres Alter zulässig sein) wird die Zustimmung der Eltern eingeholt. Den betroffenen Personen werden zum Zeitpunkt der Einholung der Einwilligung transparente Informationen über unsere Nutzung ihrer personenbezogenen Daten zur Verfügung gestellt und ihre Rechte in Bezug auf ihre Daten erläutert, beispielsweise das Recht, die Einwilligung zu widerrufen. Diese Informationen werden in zugänglicher Form, in klarer Sprache und kostenlos zur Verfügung gestellt. Wenn die personenbezogenen Daten nicht direkt bei der betroffenen Person erhoben werden, werden diese Informationen der betroffenen Person innerhalb einer angemessenen Frist nach der Datenerhebung, spätestens jedoch innerhalb eines Monats, zur Verfügung gestellt.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 Vertragserfüllung</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Soweit die erhobenen und verarbeiteten personenbezogenen Daten zur Erfüllung eines Vertrags mit der betroffenen Person erforderlich sind, ist eine ausdrückliche Einwilligung nicht erforderlich. Dies ist insbesondere dann der Fall, wenn die Vertragsabwicklung ohne die Angabe der personenbezogenen Daten nicht möglich ist, z.B. Ohne Angabe einer Lieferadresse ist eine Lieferung nicht möglich.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 Gesetzliche Verpflichtung</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Ist die Erhebung und Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten zur Einhaltung gesetzlicher Vorschriften erforderlich, ist eine ausdrückliche Einwilligung nicht erforderlich. Dies kann beispielsweise bei einigen Daten im Zusammenhang mit Beschäftigung und Steuern sowie bei vielen Bereichen, mit denen der öffentliche Sektor befasst ist, der Fall sein.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 Lebenswichtige Interessen der betroffenen Person</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Sind personenbezogene Daten erforderlich, um lebenswichtige Interessen der betroffenen Person oder einer anderen natürlichen Person zu schützen, kann dies als Rechtsgrundlage für die Verarbeitung dienen. OIS wird angemessene, dokumentierte Beweise dafür aufbewahren, dass dies der Fall ist, wenn dieser Grund als rechtmäßige Grundlage für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verwendet wird. Dies kann beispielsweise in Aspekten der Sozialfürsorge, insbesondere im öffentlichen Sektor, zum Einsatz kommen.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 Aufgabe im öffentlichen Interesse</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Wenn OIS eine Aufgabe erfüllen muss, die seiner Ansicht nach im öffentlichen Interesse liegt oder Teil einer offiziellen Pflicht ist, wird die Zustimmung der betroffenen Person nicht eingeholt. Die Beurteilung des öffentlichen Interesses bzw. der Amtspflicht wird dokumentiert und bei Bedarf als Beweismittel zur Verfügung gestellt.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 Berechtigte Interessen</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Wenn die Verarbeitung bestimmter personenbezogener Daten im berechtigten Interesse von OIS liegt und die Rechte und Freiheiten der betroffenen Person nachweislich nicht wesentlich beeinträchtigt werden, kann dies als rechtmäßiger Grund für die Verarbeitung definiert werden. Auch hier wird die Begründung dieser Ansicht dokumentiert.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.6 Datenschutz durch Technik</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              OIS hat den Grundsatz des „Privacy by Design“ übernommen und wird sicherstellen, dass bei der Definition und Planung aller neuen oder erheblich geänderten Systeme, die personenbezogene Daten sammeln oder verarbeiten, Datenschutzfragen gebührend berücksichtigt werden, einschließlich der Fertigstellung einer oder mehrerer Datenschutzauswirkungen Einschätzungen.
            </p>

              Die Datenschutz-Folgenabschätzung umfasst Folgendes:

            <p class="para-section">
              Überlegung, wie und zu welchen Zwecken personenbezogene Daten verarbeitet werden<br>Bewertung, ob die vorgeschlagene Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten sowohl notwendig als auch im Verhältnis zu den Zwecken ist.

              Übermittlungen personenbezogener Daten außerhalb der Europäischen Union werden vor der Übermittlung sorgfältig geprüft, um sicherzustellen, dass sie innerhalb der durch die DSGVO vorgegebenen Grenzen liegen. Dies hängt teilweise von der Beurteilung der Europäischen Kommission hinsichtlich der Angemessenheit der im Empfängerland geltenden Schutzmaßnahmen für personenbezogene Daten ab und kann sich im Laufe der Zeit ändern.<br>Gruppeninterne internationale Datenübermittlungen unterliegen den genannten rechtsverbindlichen Vereinbarungen in Form von Binding Corporate Rules (BCR), die den betroffenen Personen durchsetzbare Rechte verleihen.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.9 Datenschutzbeauftragter</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Eine definierte Rolle des Datenschutzbeauftragten (Data Protection Officer, DPO) ist gemäß der DSGVO erforderlich, wenn es sich bei einer Organisation um eine Behörde handelt, wenn sie groß angelegte Überwachungen durchführt oder wenn sie besonders sensible Arten von Daten in großem Umfang verarbeitet. Der Datenschutzbeauftragte muss über einen angemessenen Kenntnisstand verfügen und kann entweder eine interne Ressource sein oder an einen geeigneten Dienstleister ausgelagert werden.

            <p class="para-section">
              Es ist die Politik von OIS, fair und verhältnismäßig zu sein, wenn es darum geht, Maßnahmen zu ergreifen, um betroffene Parteien über Verstöße gegen personenbezogene Daten zu informieren. Im Einklang mit der DSGVO wird die zuständige Aufsichtsbehörde innerhalb von 72 Stunden informiert, wenn bekannt ist, dass ein Verstoß vorliegt, der voraussichtlich ein Risiko für die Rechte und Freiheiten natürlicher Personen darstellt. Dies wird in Übereinstimmung mit unserem Verfahren zur Reaktion auf Informationssicherheitsvorfälle gehandhabt, das den gesamten Prozess der Behandlung von Informationssicherheitsvorfällen festlegt.

Übermittlung personenbezogener Daten außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums<br>Ihre personenbezogenen Daten werden nicht in ein Land oder Gebiet außerhalb des Europäischen Wirtschaftsraums übermittelt, es sei denn, dieses Land oder Gebiet gewährleistet ein angemessenes Schutzniveau für die Rechte und Freiheiten der betroffenen Personen zur Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten. Es gibt nur wenige Länder außerhalb des EWR, die anerkanntermaßen über ein angemessenes Schutzniveau für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verfügen, das mit den EWR-Ländern vergleichbar ist. Wenn wir personenbezogene Daten in die USA übermitteln, stellen wir sicher, dass der Empfänger Unterzeichner des Safe Harbor Scheme des US-Handelsministeriums ist. Die Europäische Kommission erkennt an, dass dieses System einen angemessenen Schutz für betroffene Personen bietet. In Bezug auf andere Länder außerhalb des EWR, in denen nicht anerkannt wird, dass sie über gleichwertige Sicherheit und Schutzmaßnahmen für die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten verfügen, unterzeichnen wir entweder einen separaten Vertrag, dessen Bedingungen durch die europäischen Richtlinien genehmigt werden, oder stellen sicher, dass eine Klausel vorhanden ist im Vertrag, der die Verarbeitung personenbezogener Daten aller unserer Kunden schützt.

            <p class="para-section">
              Esistono sei modi alternativi in cui è possibile stabilire la liceità di un caso specifico di trattamento dei dati personali ai sensi del GDPR. È politica dell\'OIS individuare la base adeguata per il trattamento e documentarlo, in conformità con il Regolamento. Le opzioni sono descritte brevemente nelle sezioni seguenti.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 Consenso</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              A meno che non sia necessario per un motivo consentito dal GDPR, OIS otterrà sempre il consenso esplicito dell\'interessato per raccogliere ed elaborare i propri dati. In caso di bambini di età inferiore a 16 anni (un\'età inferiore potrebbe essere consentita in specifici Stati membri dell\'UE) verrà ottenuto il consenso dei genitori. Informazioni trasparenti sul nostro utilizzo dei loro dati personali saranno fornite agli interessati nel momento in cui viene ottenuto il consenso e verranno spiegati i loro diritti in relazione ai loro dati, come il diritto di revocare il consenso. Queste informazioni saranno fornite in una forma accessibile, scritta in un linguaggio chiaro e gratuitamente. Se i dati personali non sono ottenuti direttamente presso l\'interessato, tali informazioni saranno fornite all\'interessato entro un termine ragionevole dall\'ottenimento dei dati e comunque entro un mese.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 Esecuzione di un contratto</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Laddove i dati personali raccolti e trattati siano necessari per adempiere a un contratto con l’interessato, non è richiesto il consenso esplicito. Ciò accade spesso quando il contratto non può essere concluso senza i dati personali in questione, ad es. una consegna non può essere effettuata senza un indirizzo a cui consegnare.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 Obbligo legale</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Se è necessario raccogliere e trattare i dati personali per adempiere alla legge, non è richiesto il consenso esplicito. Questo potrebbe essere il caso, ad esempio, di alcuni dati relativi all’occupazione e alla tassazione, e di molti settori affrontati dal settore pubblico.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 Interessi vitali dell\'interessato</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Nel caso in cui i dati personali siano necessari per tutelare gli interessi vitali dell\'interessato o di un\'altra persona fisica, ciò può costituire la base giuridica del trattamento. OIS conserverà prove ragionevoli e documentate di ciò, ogniqualvolta tale motivo venga utilizzato come base legale del trattamento dei dati personali. Ad esempio, questo può essere utilizzato negli aspetti dell’assistenza sociale, in particolare nel settore pubblico.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 Compito svolto nell\'interesse pubblico</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Qualora l\'OIS debba svolgere un compito che ritiene sia di interesse pubblico o nell\'ambito di un dovere ufficiale, non sarà richiesto il consenso dell\'interessato. La valutazione dell\'interesse pubblico o del dovere d\'ufficio sarà documentata e resa disponibile come prova ove richiesto.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 Interessi legittimi</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Se il trattamento di dati personali specifici rientra nell’interesse legittimo di OIS e si ritiene che non pregiudichi i diritti e le libertà dell’interessato in modo significativo, ciò può essere definito motivo legittimo del trattamento. Ancora una volta, il ragionamento alla base di questo punto di vista sarà documentato.

              Un ruolo definito di Responsabile della protezione dei dati (DPO) è richiesto dal GDPR se un\'organizzazione è un\'autorità pubblica, se esegue un monitoraggio su larga scala o se tratta tipi di dati particolarmente sensibili su larga scala. Il DPO deve possedere un livello adeguato di conoscenze e può essere una risorsa interna o esternalizzata a un fornitore di servizi appropriato.

              vii. Sicurezza dei dati personali<br>I tuoi dati personali sono conservati in un ambiente molto sicuro sia fisicamente che tecnicamente. Gli ambienti in cui vengono conservati i dati personali sono interdetti a tutti i soggetti non autorizzati. L\'accesso a queste parti dei locali può avvenire esclusivamente tramite chiave elettronica rilasciata solo alle persone autorizzate. I tuoi dati personali sono accessibili sul sistema solo da persone autorizzate. Solo tali persone autorizzate possono alterare, divulgare o distruggere i tuoi dati personali. Inoltre, tali persone autorizzate possono svolgere una qualsiasi di tali funzioni solo nell’ambito dei loro compiti legittimi.

              viii. Trasferimento di dati personali al di fuori dello Spazio Economico Europeo<br>I tuoi dati personali non saranno trasferiti verso un paese o territorio al di fuori dello Spazio Economico Europeo a meno che tale paese o territorio non garantisca un livello adeguato di protezione dei diritti e delle libertà degli interessati in relazione al trattamento dei dati personali. Sono solo pochi i paesi al di fuori del SEE che sono stati riconosciuti come aventi livelli adeguati di protezione per il trattamento dei dati personali paragonabili ai paesi del SEE. Quando trasferiamo dati personali negli Stati Uniti, ci assicuriamo che il destinatario sia un firmatario del Safe Harbor Scheme del Dipartimento del Commercio degli Stati Uniti. Questo schema è riconosciuto dalla Commissione Europea come un sistema di protezione adeguata per gli interessati. In relazione ad altri paesi al di fuori del SEE che non sono stati accettati come dotati di sicurezza e tutele equivalenti per il trattamento dei dati personali, firmiamo un contratto separato, i cui termini sono approvati dalle Direttive europee o assicuriamo che vi sia una clausola nel contratto che tutela il trattamento dei dati personali di tutti i nostri clienti.

            <p class="para-section">
              Existen seis formas alternativas de establecer la legalidad de un caso específico de procesamiento de datos personales según el RGPD. Es política de la OIS identificar la base adecuada para el procesamiento y documentarlo, de conformidad con el Reglamento. Las opciones se describen brevemente en las siguientes secciones.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.1 Consentimiento</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              A menos que sea necesario por un motivo permitido en el GDPR, OIS siempre obtendrá el consentimiento explícito de un interesado para recopilar y procesar sus datos. En el caso de niños menores de 16 años (es posible que se permita una edad inferior en determinados estados miembros de la UE), se obtendrá el consentimiento de los padres. Se proporcionará información transparente sobre nuestro uso de sus datos personales a los interesados en el momento en que se obtenga el consentimiento y se les expliquen sus derechos con respecto a sus datos, como el derecho a retirar el consentimiento. Esta información se proporcionará de forma accesible, escrita en un lenguaje claro y de forma gratuita. Si los datos personales no se obtienen directamente del interesado, esta información se proporcionará al interesado en un plazo razonable tras la obtención de los datos y, definitivamente, en el plazo de un mes.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.2 Ejecución de un contrato</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Cuando los datos personales recopilados y procesados sean necesarios para cumplir un contrato con el interesado, no se requiere consentimiento explícito. Este será a menudo el caso cuando el contrato no pueda completarse sin los datos personales en cuestión, p. No se puede realizar una entrega sin una dirección a la que realizar la entrega.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.3 Obligación legal</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Si es necesario recopilar y procesar datos personales para cumplir con la ley, no se requiere consentimiento explícito. Este puede ser el caso de algunos datos relacionados con el empleo y la tributación, por ejemplo, y de muchas áreas abordadas por el sector público.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.4 Intereses vitales del interesado</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              En el caso de que los datos personales sean necesarios para proteger los intereses vitales del interesado o de otra persona física, estos podrán utilizarse como base legal del procesamiento. OIS conservará evidencia razonable y documentada de que este es el caso, siempre que este motivo se utilice como base legal para el procesamiento de datos personales. Por ejemplo, esto se puede utilizar en aspectos de la atención social, particularmente en el sector público.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.5 Tarea realizada en interés público</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Cuando OIS necesite realizar una tarea que considere de interés público o como parte de un deber oficial, no se solicitará el consentimiento del interesado. La evaluación del interés público o del deber oficial se documentará y se pondrá a disposición como prueba cuando sea necesario.
            </p>
            <div class="sub-title pl-0">2.5.6 Intereses legítimos</div>
            <p class="para-section">
              Si el procesamiento de datos personales específicos responde a los intereses legítimos de OIS y se considera que no afecta los derechos y libertades del interesado de manera significativa, entonces esto puede definirse como la razón legal para el procesamiento. Una vez más, se documentará el razonamiento detrás de esta opinión.
            </p>

            <p class="para-section">
              La OIS ha adoptado el principio de privacidad desde el diseño y garantizará que la definición y planificación de todos los sistemas nuevos o significativamente modificados que recopilen o procesen datos personales estén sujetos a la debida consideración de las cuestiones de privacidad, incluida la finalización de uno o más impactos en la protección de datos. evaluaciones.
